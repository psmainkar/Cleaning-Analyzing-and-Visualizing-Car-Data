Embark on a journey through the data lifecycle in our project focused on car datasets sourced from Kaggle. Beginning with a raw and unclean dataset, we deploy SQL for comprehensive cleaning, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we unravel insights, trends, and anomalies within the dataset, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns. Finally, leveraging the visualization capabilities of Power BI, we transform our cleaned dataset into interactive and visually engaging dashboards, empowering stakeholders to glean actionable insights effortlessly.
